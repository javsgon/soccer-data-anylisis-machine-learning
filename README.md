# Data Analysis and Machine Learning

## Project Objective
- Use of different ML algorithms learned as well as functions and steps practiced during different exercises.

## Libraries used
These are the libraries used in the entire project:

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib
3. Scikit-learn
4. Seaborn

## xG - Points Regression
The sports management of a football club has requested us to develop a model to predict, based on their team's xG (Expected Goals) in the season, how many points the team has. By having a historical record of teams with their xG in the season and the points they obtained, we can draw several conclusions: whether there is a certain relationship between a team's attacking prowess and the points it earns, and whether at the end of the season, the club has performed better or worse than expected in relation to xG versus Points.

## Classification - Top 10 in the league
The sports management of a Spanish football club has asked us to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a team will finish in the top ten or not, in other words, in the top half of the league standings. The idea they have is that if they have a historical dataset and can predict whether a team will be among the best performers or not based on their performance in that season, they could draw conclusions before the end of the season and anticipate what's to come.
In the meeting, they mentioned that the historical match data refers to the 2017/2018 season and includes the top European leagues: Spain, Italy, Germany, France, and England. They informed us that the dataset includes team names, the competition, the season, xG (Expected Goals), xA (Expected Assists), position, and whether the team finished in the top half or the bottom half. They are conducting this analysis because they are highly interested in knowing whether being an attacking team with collaborative play tends to lead a team to be among the top performers.

## Forward Clustering
The sports club we work for has mentioned the need to find an interesting center forward in the market. They have asked for our assistance in getting to know the available center forwards better and grouping them together. This way, they can gain a better understanding of which players are similar to each other and draw more insightful conclusions before entering the market. If a specific player catches our interest, we can search for similar players to see if they are equally intriguing and if an opportunity arises.

## Dimensionality Reduction - Player Similar to Paulo Dybala
A European football club with a substantial budget has asked us to find the player most similar to Paulo Dybala. This player is of significant interest to the club, but a transfer is not possible, hence they need help in finding the most similar midfielder. They provide us with a dataset of midfielders from the top European leagues for the 2017/2018 season. Therefore, the metrics they offer are from that year. They assume that the similarity we achieve would be based on that year's data, but they find it worthwhile nonetheless.
We need to work with this dataset to identify midfielders who are most similar to the given footballer based on the metrics from that year, essentially "finding the most similar footballers from that year." With this information, the scouting department will start analyzing in more detail.
